# Pair-finder

Write classes to find any pairs of numbers in a sequence that add up to 10. Example:

	Sample input: 1, 8, 2, 3, 5, 7
	Sample output: “(8,2), (3, 7)”

Your code must include the following:

•	A class to encapsulate a pair of numbers.
◦	Feel free to add features to this class that would be useful for this exercise.
•	A utility class that finds the pairs. This must have:
◦	A constructor.
◦	A method or function that takes a list of numbers (input).
◦	A method or function that returns a list of pairs of numbers (output).
◦	A method or function that can use the list of pairs and output formatted answer strings such as:
“(8, 2), (3 7)”.
